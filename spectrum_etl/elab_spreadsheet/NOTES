eLab_test_sheet.xlsm is a test sheet that goes with eLab sample type called test_sample_import

todo: The actual copy-paste step is vulnerable to human error. To eliminate chance for human error at this step in the process, a possible solution is to have a monitoring process that compares values in stored spreadsheets to values in eLab. Until such a process is set up, the user must make sure to do manual visual verification after copy-paste is performed


@todo: add unit tests to verify show/hide states for each conditional.
