eLab_test_sheet.xlsm is a test sheet that goes with eLab sample type called test_sample_import

todo : - each excel sheet should have a list of tests mentioned that can be conducted manually each time a change is made (sort of like manual unit tests)

todo: would be good to use constants in the macros instead of hardcoding values in the functions

todo: The actual copy-paste step is vulnerable to human error. To eliminate chance for human error at this step in the process, a possible solution is to have a monitoring process that compares values in stored spreadsheets to values in eLab. Until such a process is set up, the user must make sure to do manual visual verification after copy-paste is performed


Questions for Jamie:
Should we rename "Sorted scRNA sequencing" in eLab to Sorted Single Cell Sequencing for Downstream Submission to be consistent with spreadsheet?
We have 2 "Sequencing Info" sections in eLab. Can we give them different names?
There is an inconsistency between the headers "Inclusion Status" and "Diagnosis" (as to what fields they include) between Excel and eLab sample type Sections.
There are two "Downstream Submission" fields - in PPBC and Processing Info sections. Should name them differently?
