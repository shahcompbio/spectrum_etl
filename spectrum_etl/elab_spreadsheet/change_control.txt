This procedure must be followed for every change made to the elab spreadsheets.

1. Make one change to eLab sample template

2. Test entire eLab sample template, especially if field change is related to conditional trigger field(s" or conditional section(s"

3. Make corresponding change to eLab sample spreadsheet.

4. Do a field to field comparison between eLab fields and excel sheet fields.

3. Go through the following change-control tests

3.1. Cycle through opening and closing spreadsheet while making a change to test Workbook_open event.

3.2. Ensure that default values are provided for all fields. Being explicit can help avoid accidental omissions.

3.3. Make sure all fields in eLab template are set to be required. This aligns with point 2 above.

3.4. Ensure order of field names in elab sample definition matches order of field names in corresponding Excel columns.

3.5. Test the following functions
    - Open workbook, expand all columns, Save, close, open workbook again and verify that all hidden columns are hidden.
    - verify as triggers the first, a middle and the last cell in each conditional column for show/hide functionality.
    - "Expand Columns and Copy Paste Data" - verify expansion of all conditional columns. Verify proper bounding rectangle.
    - "Shrink Columns" - verify function for all conditional columns, and first, middle, last as cells in each conditional column as triggers for show/hide.
