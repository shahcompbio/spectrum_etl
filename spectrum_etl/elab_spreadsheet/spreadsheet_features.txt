Spreadsheet Features:
---------------------

1. The spreadsheet shows or hides columns (or fields) based on the values of cells in other columns called conditional columns (or conditional fields)

2. On opening the spreadsheet, columns that should be hidden are hidden.

3. As user enters values in the conditional columns, the dependent columns are either shown or hidden based on the values entered. This is done through the excel macros event handler.

4. A button is provided to expand all columns, copy all cell values to clipboard.

5. A button is provided to hide only those columns that should be kept hidden.
