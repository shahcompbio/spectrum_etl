Process:

The list below details the process that must be followed when entering data into eLab.

1. Create copy of the workbook and save under another name (patient_id_surgery_id)

2. Make sure Excel has Auto-Save set to on

3. Populate data in spreadsheet.

4. Create an empty sample import form on eLab with the specified some of sample entries. See https://www.elabinventory.com/doc/ImportingSamples.html

5. Press the "Expand Columns and Copy Paste Data" button on the spreadsheet.

6. IMPORTANT: Make sure to place the cursor on the top left cell before pasting.

7. Press the button "Paste from clipboard" and paste the data in

8. Verify if data was properly pasted by ensuring all columns are filled correctly, not empty cells exist and there are no errors flagged.

9. IMPORTANT: If an error is flagged by eLab after a copy-paste, the error must be fixed in the excel sheet first. Cancel out of the copy-pasted form and create a new empty import form to copy paste into. Do not try to overwrite by pasting into a prefilled form. This is highly error prone.

10. If copy-pasted data looks good, press the import button.

11. Protect sheet to prevent accidental edits and save.
